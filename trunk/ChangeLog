web10g-userland-2.0.6.2:

	Added record-to-file read/write functions and data type.

	Added listconninfo structure and functions for associating uid,
	pid, cmdline, to connection tuple.

	Reverted naming conventions for functions/lib to "estats".

	Added doc/API.txt giving an overview and explication of main lib
	functions.

	Minor bug fixes.

web10g-userland-2.0.4:

	Fixed reporting of IPv6 addresses in tcpe_list_conns.

	Added tcpe_write_var function and example client (writevar).
	N.B. currently writevar is only implemented for two of the four
	writable variables defined in RFC 4898, LimCwnd and LimRwin.
	This is an initial implementation, and deserves further testing,
	but has been included in this release for consideration.

	Added function tcpe_data_delta for taking difference of counters,
	and client deltavars.
